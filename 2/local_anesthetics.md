# Local Anesthetic Agents

---

## Local Anesthesia:
- Loss of sensation in a limited region of the body  

## Local Anesthetics:
**Definition:** Drugs that reversibly block impulse conduction along nerve axons and other excitable membranes by blocking Na+ channels without loss of consciousness.  

- They are used to block pain sensation in specific areas of the body  
- **Cocaine:** 1st local anesthetic agent  
- **Procaine, Lidocaine:** Prototype 
- None of the currently available drugs are ideal  

---

## Chemistry
All local anesthetics (LA) consist of:  
- A **lipophilic aromatic group**  
- Joined to a **hydrophilic tertiary amine base**  
- Connected by an **intermediate amide or ester bond**  

---

## General Properties
- All local anesthetics are weak bases  
- In acidic media: ionized and less absorbed  
- **pK:** The pK of most local anesthetics is 7.5–9.0  
  - Exception: Benzocaine (pKa 3.5)
  - pK is the pH where 50% of the drug is ionized and 50% unionized)  
- Less effective when injected into infected tissues (low extracellular pH)

## Properties of an Ideal Local Anesthetic
1. Rapid onset of action  
2. Duration of action should be sufficient to allow surgical procedure
3. Effects should be completely reversible
4. No local or systemic toxicity  
5. No local irritation or tissue damage  
6. Should be effective when injected into tissues or applied topically to mucous membrane (regional or localized)
7. Generally no long-term side effects

## Classification of Local Anesthetics

### According to structure of Intermediate Chain
- **Esters:** Cocaine, Procaine, Tetracaine, Benzocaine  
- **Amides:** Lidocaine (Lignocaine), Articaine, Prilocaine, Mepivacaine, Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine  

### According to duration of Action
- **Short-acting (15–30 min):** Procaine  
- **Intermediate-acting (30–90 min):** Cocaine, Lidocaine, Articaine, Mepivacaine, Prilocaine  
- **Long-acting (2–4 hrs):** Tetracaine, Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine  

---

### Esters
- Distribution: Not extensively studied  
- Serum half-life & duration of action:  
  - Procaine: Short (<1 min)  
  - Cocaine: Medium  
  - Tetracaine: Long  

### Amides
- Widely distributed after IV bolus injection  
- Duration of action:  
  - Medium: Lidocaine, Mepivacaine, Prilocaine  
  - Long: Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine  
- Metabolized by **CP450**  
- Excreted by kidney  

## Pharmacokinetics

- Can be given topically or by injection  
- Systemic absorption depends on:  
  - Dosage
  - Site of injection  
  - Drug Tissue binding
  - Local tissue blood flow  
  - Presence of vasoconstrictor  
  - Physicochemical properties (lipid solubility)
- Serum half life and duration of action:
  - Procaine: Short (<1 min)
  - Cocaine, Lidocaine, Mepivacaine, Prilocaine: Medium
  - Tetracaine, Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine: Long.
  - Bind extensively with protein. Can be displaced from protein binding sites by other protein bound drugs
- Metabolism:
  - Ester: Hydrolyzed rapidly by pseudocholinesterase to inactive metabolites in plasma
  - Amide: Metabolized by Cp450 in the liver
- Excretion: In the urine. Acidification of urine promotes ionization of the tertiary amine and leads to rapid elimination

---

## Mechanism of Action
- Local anesthetics bind to the **inner side of voltage-gated Na+ channels** and block the channel
- Local anesthetics work on the afferent nerve fibers or pain fibers.
- When increasing concentration of a local anesthetic is applied to a nerve fiber threshold for excitation increases → impulse conduction slows rate of rise of action potential declines → action potential amplitude decreases → ability to generate an action potential is abolished

## Pharmacological Effects
- LA can provide temporary but complete analgesia of well defined parts in the body. LA prevents pain by interrupting nerve conduction
- Weak neuromuscular blocking effect
- Quinidine like action in the heart
- Excitation of parts of CNS  

---

## Clinical Uses:
- LA is generally used to provide temporary but complete analgesia where loss of consciousness is neither necessary nor desirable
- Also can be used as an adjunct to major surgery to avoid high dose of GA
- Post operative analgesia instead of opioids (slow epidural infusion)
- Dental procedures: Articaine preferred (Fast onset of action & intermediate duration), Lignocaine
- Used in labor to reduce pain (epidural)

---

## Adverse Effects:
### 1. CNS
- Sedation
- Light-headedness  
- Visual & auditory disturbances  
- Restlessness  
- Neurotoxicity: All LA can produce direct neurotoxicity when applied in excessive and high concentration
- More with chloroprocaine and lidocaine
- Transient neuropathic symptoms (due to irritation)

### 2. CVS
- Direct cardiac or ANS effects  
- Hypotension: Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine (Check the BP before giving local anesthetic)

### 3. Blood
- **Methemoglobinemia (Prilocaine):** Due to metabolite o-toluidine which converts Hb to MethHb  
- Treatment: Methylene blue (reducing agent)

### 4. Allergic Reactions
- Rash, asthma, anaphylactic shock 
- **Amide LA:** Less allergic  
- **Ester LA:** More allergic  

### How can you prolong the drug action of local anesthetics?
- By adding vasoconstrictor substance - Adrenaline
- Adrenaline acts on a, receptor and produces vasoconstriction and decrease blood flow to the injection site and decrease systemic absorption of LA from depot site

---

### Benefits of added vasoconstrictor
- Longer duration → Leading to
  - Adequate anesthesia for prolonged period
  - Extended duration of postoperative pain control
  - Lower total anesthetic requirement
- Risk of systemic toxic effect is reduced

### What are the dangers of adrenaline?
- Delay in healing of wounds
- Tissue edema
- Necrosis of local part

### Choice of Local Anesthetic:
- No agent ideal
- Lignlocaine may be safest and best for surface anesthesia
- Lignocaine, Prilocaine - for infiltration

---

## Procedures of use of local anesthetics
- _**Topical or Surface anesthesia**_
  - Nasal mucosa, wound (incision site) margins, injection in the vicinity of peripheral nerve endings and major nerve trunks (blocks), injection into the epidural or subarachnoid space
  - Not effective for skin
  - Lidocaine, Tetracaine, Benzocaine, Dibucaine
- _**Infiltration anesthesia**_
  - Injection of LA under the skin
  - Paralyze sensory the nerve endings and small cutaneous nerves
  - Used to perform minor surgery
  - Most of the LA
- _**Regional Block**_
  - Involve the injection near a nerve or nerve plexus proximal to the surgical site
  - Provides excellent anesthesia for a variety of procedures

---

## Types of Regional Block
1. Nerve block  
2. Intravenous regional anesthesia  
3. Epidural (extradural)  
4. Spinal (subarachnoid, intrathecal)

### 1. Nerve block
- Anesthetize a region by injecting the drug around the peripheral nerve or a plexus
- Most of the LAs can be used to block nerves for surgery, dentistry, analgesia
- Special forms
- Brachial plexus block -Upper extremity
- Sciatic, Femoral or Obturator block - Lower extremity

### 2. Intravenous Regional Anesthesia
- LA injected intravenously distal to a-pressure cuff to arrest blood flow
- Remains effective until the circulation is restored
- Can be used in limb surgery
- Lidocaine, Prilocaine

### 3. Extradural (Epidural) Anesthesia
- Injected into the extradural space to act on nerve root
- Used in thoiracic, lumber and sacral region
- Widely used in obstetrics
- Avoids potentially serious hazards of putting foreign substances into CSF
- Risk of head ache and hypotension is less than spinal anesthesia

### 4. Spinal Anesthesia
- Drug is directly introduced into the spinal fluid
- Produces extensive and profound anesthesia
- **Site of action:** - Spinal nerve roots, spinal ganglia and perhaps spinal cord
- Onset of action - Rapid
- Hypotension occurs due to blockade of sympathetic nervous system
- Headache occurs due to CSF leakage
